Free Pascal hash maps
======================

This repository contains the source need to run a benchmark of string-key based (hash)maps available for Free Pascal. 

See http://www.benibela.de/fpc-map-benchmark_en.html for the results.

Summary of recommendations:
  
*  contnrs.TFPHashList is usable for short keys and old fpc versions

*  rtl-generics.collections works on newer fpc versions

*  3rd party maps perform generally well
